## Project 1

### Introduction

The **ava 2D Side Scrolling Dinosaur Game** is a simple yet engaging game developed using Java, inspired by the Chrome Dinosaur Game. The player controls a dinosaur that has to avoid obstacles by jumping. The game increases in difficulty as time progresses.

### Features

- Endless runner-style gameplay.
- Simple, intuitive controls (spacebar to jump).
- Randomly generated obstacles with increasing speed.
- Score tracking system.
- Game over detection when the dinosaur hits an obstacle.

## Project 2

### Introduction

The **Home Automation System** uses a **NodeMCU** microcontroller to automate various home devices. The system allows control of appliances such as lights, fans, and other IoT-enabled devices remotely through a mobile app or web interface.

### How to Setup

1. Clone the repository:
 ```
 git clone (https://github.com/ayushkamboj9/Projects/tree/main/NodeMCU%20Home_Automation_System.git)

 ```
2. Navigate to the ```HomeAutomation``` directory:
 ```
 cd HomeAutomation
 ```
3. Open the ```HomeAutomation.ino``` file in the Arduino IDE:
4. Set up the necessary libraries (Blynk, ESP8266WiFi, etc.).
5. Upload the code to the NodeMCU.
6. Connect the devices as per the circuit diagram provided in the docs/ folder.
7. Use the Google Home and ALEXA App to control your devices.
